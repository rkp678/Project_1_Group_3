## Project Title:
Let's Put the "Fun" in Non-Fungible Tokens

## Project Description/Outline:

Our project is to research and learn patterns and trends in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).  We will be using the OpenSea API to retrieve data regarding NFTs to determine the following:
- What are NFTs?
- What are the financial trends?
- How profitable are NFTs?

#

## Brief Background of NFTs:
What are NFTs?
- NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, are unique assets that can’t be replaced with something else, and are verified and stored using blockchain technology.  They can include everything from music to a website domain, but the current craze is really around digital artwork. The market exceeded $10B in transaction volume as of 3Q2021.

Examples of Recently Sold NFTs:
- The NFT art scene has exploded in recent months, with some of the most expensive NFT sales conducted in the last six months.  A few examples include: CryptoPunk #7523 ($11.8 million), CryptoPunk #7804 ($7.56 million), Ocean Front ($6 million), and the World Wide Web source code ($5.43 million).

Minting and Purchasing an NFT:
- For NFTs to become valuable and scarce they have to be minted. The term minting in NFTs is similar to minting a coin of silver. Once an NFT is minted on the Ethereum blockchain it becomes unchangeable and tamper-proof. Newly minted NFTs then are able to be sold on third party websites. These websites include Nifty Gateway, Zora, and OpeanSea to name a few.  For a buyer to purchase an NFT they have to purchase the NFT using Ethereum Tokens.  Other blockchain networks that mint NFTs beside Ethereum include Solana, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain, to name a few. Yet Ethereum reigns supreme for NFTs on chain.

The Rise of NFTs:
- NFTs have only been around for a little over a half a decade so they have not become commonplace in today’s society. Yet the NFT space has gained some notoriety this past year due to the fact that massive amounts of money have been allocated to purchase some NFT projects. The vast majority of people in the NFT space, which are the artists and buyers, are between the ages of 18-39.

##  Data and Research Questions:
Based on our analysis of the data included in the OpenSea API, we refined our data visualizations to the following achievable results.  The data was broken apart into exploration, cleanup, and analysis phases as seen in the JupyterLab notebooks.  Refer to the **Visualizations.ipynb** and **XXXXX.ipynb** files in GitHub for code details, and the **NFT Presentation Dashboard** for the full presentation (including narratives and visualizations).  Visualizations and conclusions included in the project are as follows:
1. NFT Bid Trends - add conclusion
2. Number of NFT Sales Per Day - add conclusion
1. Volume of Sales Per Day - add conclusion
2. Number of Sales Per Token ID- add conclusion
2. Top 10 Bids - add conclusion
1. Total Buyers/Sellers - add conclusion
2. Top 5 NFT Projects by Market Cap- add conclusion
1. TBD - ANDREW to use another library

#

## Overall Dashboard:
We combined all visualizations as well as narratives into a dashboard for our presentation. Please refer to the **NFT Presentation Dashboard** in GitHub for the document.

#

## Datasets Used:
We will be using data obtained from the OpenSea API and Ethereum API.

#

## Additional Notes:
We requested API access on 10/28/21 from OpenSea.  Message request: "Requesting access to API for University of MN Fintech Bootcamp Project involving API use and NFT research.  Will use OpenSea financial data to analyze trends in NFT sales and predict future activity."  We never received access, so data obtained for this project is based on the public API data.
