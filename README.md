## Project Description/Outline:

### We will be using the OpenSea API to retrieve data regarding NFTs to determine the following:

- What are the financial trends?
- How profitable are NFTs?

#

##  Draft Research Questions:
### Get ideas down and refine these to be more achievable. Break apart into exploration and cleanup phase, then analysis phase.
1. What are NFTs? (narrative section)
2. What are the sales trends in NFTs the past four years? (Use this question to determine if NFTs are a good investment, use line chart)
2.  Sales trends for top 20 projects (use line chart).
3.  What chain are NFTs on and what is the volume on each? (Use bar chart)
1. What are the value trends in Ethereum? (NFTs are purchased with ETH so it is important to track this - use line chart)
2. What is the market cap of top five NFTs? (bar chart)
1. Determine liquidity of this type of NFT - how often have they been traded?  How liquid are they? (Use this question to determine the saleability of the asset)
2. Who are the most profitable NFT artists?  (Use to determine the most profitable artists to invest in)
1. What are the most valuable pieces?
